1 - MARVEL VS CAPCOM BASICS


The basic combination of attacks from the Marvel VS Capcom series was partially recreated, being the following secuence of inputs the maximum common available:

LP - LK - MP - MK - HP - HK

Bear in mind that the timing may be different for each character.



2 - NEW TARGET COMBOS


Almost every existing Target combo in the game was replaced with new ones, some with different restrictions on when the player can perform those combos
(Such as Only when hitting the oponnent, Only when the Oponnent is Blocking and with no Hit Restrictions)

Ryu's Target Combo: FHP - FMP - CLK



3 - LAUNCHING ATTACKS AND AERIAL COMBOS


The Launching Attacks were added to every character and some have an unique way of sending the opponent into the air. The common way to perform this attack is "CHP", but for some can be another input or even a Wall Bounce attack.

Immediatly after the player now has the ability to do Aerial Combos, which work for the mos part exactly the same as the Basic combination on the ground.
There are various ways to finish them, either with the character's Finishing Blow(s) or if possible, with an Special Attack.



4 - MOMENTARY COMBOS


The Momentary Combos implemented in this mod doesn't work exactly like in the polygonal classic, instead these ones are as such:
A few selection of the character's special moves can be cancelled into another, but you must do the entire input motion followed by the correct buton in order to succesfully make use of the Momentary combo.



5 - EX COUNTERS


A new addition to the package comes in the form of the called "EX Counters", a defensive move (Essentially two of the character's EX Moves) that gives a chance
of interrup instantly a combo or an attack while blocking if done correctly. Each one posses 2, and under these conditions:

EX COUNTER 1: Available only within The first frame of the Blocking Animation, either Standing or Crouching.

EX COUNTER 2: Available only within The first 3 frames of any Ground Damage Animation.



6 - SUPER AND ULTRA COMBO MINOR CHANGES


The only thing that was changed to the mayority of Super and Ultra Combos was the meter cost.


For the Super Combos, now depending on the button pressed it will cost less or more meter. The "Level of Super" works as the following:

LEVEL 1: Super Combo done withLow Attack
LEVEL 2: Super Combo done withMedium Atack
LEVEL 3: Super Combo done withHigh Attack

QUICK NOTE 1: C. Viper is the only character in the game that has Reverse input levels of Super Combo
QUICK NOTE 2: Because not every character in the game change properties depending on the button pressed, not everyone will use this new mechanic.


For the Ultra Combos, every character except Juri's First (Feng Shui Engine) will be able to use them only spending half of the Revenge meter. (Additional information on the video)



Final Information


- The AI will not make use of the new gameplay mechanics due to it's programming. This limits the amount of training potential if the user wants to practice for a future match online, so the best way to play this mod is either that way directly, or via local multiplayer.

- There's a bug that can happen with Dudley where he'll freeze his Focus Attack animation once it connects with the oponnent, this happened only once during a test playtrough of the Arcade mode (The Final normal boss Seth) and then it didn't happen after it, so watch out for that.

- Somethimes many of the characters will not be able to connect a HP or HK after a MK for what i believe, their active frames are instant, making it somewhat annoying as this was not intended to be this way, you may have luck and connect those moves but only with a frame perfect timing as soon as the MK animation starts.
